      "opportunity": "The idea came from a friend working on the project. They noticed that many coaches struggle to manage their clients effectively, especially when they have multiple clients with different training programs and schedules. They therefore started this project to solve this problem.",
      "solution": "Imagine you are a sports coach with several clients with varying needs. Before Tidaka, you used Excel and WhatsApp... not very efficient. With Tidaka, each coach and client has their own app. You create or choose a training plan, schedule it, the client is notified, starts training, and you track their progress in real time, with the ability to communicate and make adjustments via the app.",
      "features": {
        "connection": "To connect with a student, the coach has to send an invitation code to the student.",
        "training_plan_creation": "The coach can create a new training plan by selecting the exercises, sets, reps, and rest time. They can leverage the existing library of exercises with more than 200 exercises videos created by professionals.",
        "training_plan_execution": "Once the training plan is created and sent, the student can only start the training plan on their scheduled days. While doing the exercises, the student can track the number of reps, the weight used, and the rest time.",
        "meeting": "Either the coach or the student can schedule a meeting. The coach can set his availability and the student can choose a time slot. The meeting will be added to the calendar of both the coach and the student.",
        "gamification": "To keep the student motivated, the app automatically sets up goals and rewards. The student can earn points by completing exercises, and can redeem them for rewards on a marketplace."
      },
      "tech_stack": "To create this app, I used React Native for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database. I also used Socket.io for real-time communication between the coach and the student. The app is available on both iOS and Android."
