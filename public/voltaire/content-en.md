Voltaire is an AI-powered writing assistant that adapts to your unique style and voice. The application enables users to write, edit, and enhance texts while adapting to each user's specific style and requirements.

## Background
The idea emerged from the observation that many people waste considerable time writing and formatting their texts. Whether it's professionals who need to regularly produce content or occasional users facing complex writing tasks, they all encounter the same challenges: finding inspiration, structuring their ideas, and ensuring the final result meets their expectations.

## Opportunity
Imagine you need to write an important document but don't know where to start. Before Voltaire, you would have spent hours staring at a blank page, consulting various sources of information and attempting multiple versions. With Voltaire, you simply converse with the chatbot that guides you to clarify your ideas. You import relevant contexts (documents, videos, images), and Voltaire adapts to your writing style.

## Features

### Authentication

### Version Control

Version control allows you to track the evolution of your documents. You can revert to previous versions, compare changes, and restore specific passages if needed.

### Context Import

The context import feature is particularly powerful, enabling the integration of data from diverse sources (PDFs, images, voice recordings, YouTube videos, Excel files...) that Voltaire analyzes to enrich its suggestions and understanding of your project.

### Project Management

Project management capabilities allow you to capitalize on previous work. Voltaire guides you in identifying important data to import and automatically creates pages with relevant contexts already integrated, significantly reducing preparation time for recurring tasks.
