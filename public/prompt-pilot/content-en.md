Prompt Pilot is an application that enables users to generate optimized prompts in XML format. It streamlines the creation and management of high-quality prompts to enhance interactions with LLMs and chatbots.

## Context
With the emergence of LLMs and other chatbots, prompt quality has become crucial for obtaining relevant results. However, crafting effective prompts can be time-consuming and repetitive, particularly when structuring complex requests.
We therefore developed Prompt Pilot to address this challenge and democratize access to quality prompts.

## Opportunity
Imagine you regularly work with AI and need to create numerous structured prompts. Before Prompt Pilot, you spent considerable time manually drafting each prompt, managing their XML formatting, and organizing them across scattered files... hardly efficient. With Prompt Pilot, you simply input your request, the application automatically generates an optimized XML-formatted prompt, you can customize it if needed, and store it for future reuse.

## Features

### Authentication

To access the application, users can authenticate via Google, Github, or use Magic Link for passwordless authentication. This approach simplifies access while maintaining security standards.

### Prompt Generation

Users can input a request in natural language and the application automatically generates a structured prompt in XML format. The system optimizes phrasing, adds appropriate tags, and structures content to maximize effectiveness with LLMs.

### Prompt Management

Once generated, prompts can be saved, organized, and modified.

Users have access to a personal library where they can retrieve, edit, and reuse their prompts according to their needs.

### Export and Sharing
Prompts can be exported in various formats or shared with other users. This feature enables efficient collaboration and allows proven prompts to be reused across different projects and teams.
