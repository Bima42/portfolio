Tidaka is a mobile application that connects fitness trainers with their clients. It allows trainers to manage their schedules, track their clients' progress, and communicate with them in real-time.

## Context
The idea came from a friend who was working on the project. They noticed that many trainers struggle to efficiently manage their clients, especially when they have multiple clients with different training programs and schedules.
They started this project to solve this problem.

## Opportunity
Imagine you're a fitness coach with several clients who have different needs. Before Tidaka, you used Excel and WhatsApp... not very efficient. With Tidaka, each coach and client has their own app. You create or choose a workout plan, schedule it, the client gets notified, starts the workout, and you track their progress in real-time, with the ability to communicate and make adjustments through the app.

## Features

### Connection

To connect with a student, the coach must send them an invitation code. Using this code, the student can sign up and connect to the application.

### Creating workout programs

The trainer can create a new workout program by selecting exercises, sets, reps, and rest time. They can use the existing library that contains over 200 exercise videos created by professionals.

### Executing the workout program

Once the workout program is created and sent, the student can only start the workout program on scheduled days. During exercises, the student can track the number of reps, weight used, and rest time.

### Meeting scheduling

The coach or student can schedule a meeting. The coach can set their availability and the student can choose a time slot. The meeting will be added to both the coach's and student's calendar.

### Gamification
